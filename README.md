# Decentralized Voting System with ML Verification

This project is a decentralized voting system built using Django. It ensures secure and tamper-proof voting through blockchain technology and employs machine learning (ML) for voter verification based on Aadhaar card, voter ID, and face recognition.

## Features
- **Decentralized Voting**: Uses blockchain technology to ensure vote integrity and tamper-proofing.
- **ML-Based Verification**: 
  - Verifies voter's face, Aadhaar, and voter ID using machine learning algorithms.
- **Data Security**: Implements robust mechanisms to safeguard sensitive user data.
- **Custom Admin Panel**: Includes a unique admin panel for managing data and operations.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Blockchain**: For secure vote tamper-proofing
- **Machine Learning**: Used for verification of Aadhaar, voter ID, and face recognition
- **Frontend**: (Looking for a developer)

---

## Current Progress
- All database tables and fields are created.
- Backend logic for admin operations and voting functionality is under development.
- Seeking a **frontend developer** to design and implement the user interface.
